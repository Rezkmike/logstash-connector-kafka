To effectively test sending messages through Logstash to Kafka and verify that the message is encrypted, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Ensure your Docker Compose environment with Kafka, Zookeeper, and Logstash is up and running as configured previously. Make sure the Logstash configuration includes the encryption setup in the filter section.

### Step 2: Send a Test Message

You can send a test message to Logstash to see how it gets processed. Logstash is configured to accept input from `stdin`, so you can simply type a message into your terminal where the Logstash container is running. If you're using a different input method, adjust accordingly.

Open a terminal and use Docker to interact with the running Logstash container:
```bash
docker exec -it <logstash_container_id_or_name> bash
```

Once inside the container, you can interact with Logstash via stdin by running:
```bash
bin/logstash -f /usr/share/logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf
```

Type your message into the console, something like:
```
Hello, this is a test message!
```

Press `Enter`, and Logstash will process this input.

### Step 3: Verify Message in Kafka

To check if the message has been encrypted and sent to Kafka, you will need to consume messages from the Kafka topic using Kafka's command-line tools. You'll want to do this from inside the Kafka container if you're using Docker Compose.

1. **Access the Kafka Container:**
```bash
docker exec -it <kafka_container_id_or_name> bash
```

2. **Consume Messages from the Kafka Topic:**
Use the Kafka console consumer tool to read messages from the topic. Replace `your_topic` with the actual topic name you configured in Logstash.
```bash
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic your_topic --from-beginning
```

### Step 4: Interpret the Results

When you consume the messages from Kafka, observe the following:
- **Encrypted Data**: The message should appear as a Base64 encoded string (if you enabled Base64 in your Logstash cipher filter), indicating it's encrypted. It won't be readable directly as the original message you input.
- **Message Integrity**: Ensure there are no errors or warnings in the output that suggest issues with the data processing pipeline.

### Step 5: Automate the Testing Process (Optional)

For ongoing development, you might want to automate this testing process. You can do so using a script or a small application that sends messages to Logstash, then reads from Kafka and verifies the encryption.

Here is an example of a simple test scenario:

1. **Automated Sender**: Use a scripting language like Python to simulate sending data to Logstash's input (for example, through a TCP socket if you change the input configuration).
2. **Automated Consumer**: Use a Kafka client library in Python (like `kafka-python`) to consume messages from Kafka and verify if they are encrypted correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to effectively test sending messages through Logstash, ensuring they're encrypted, and viewing these encrypted messages in Kafka. This process provides a good checkpoint to validate that your data processing pipeline maintains the confidentiality of the data as intended.
